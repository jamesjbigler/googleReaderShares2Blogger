I created this app because Google removed the Note In Reader functionality from Google Reader.  To replace this this functionality I am using the Blog This bookmarklet and adding my shared items to my blog.  

To use this tool open up reader and go to settings.  Go to the export tab and download your shared items in the google format.  Then run this app.  

You need to enter your username, password.  Then select your blog (may need to click twice).    

Blogger only lets you import 50 posts a day.  In the Skip To Post field enter 0 the first time you run the tool.  This will import the first 50 posts.  The next day enter 50 and the tool will import posts 50-100.  The third day enter 100 and so on.

Then open your downloaded file.  You should see the posts it will import.

Next click the Import button.  It will take a couple minutes.  Go to your blog's homepage to see when it is done.
